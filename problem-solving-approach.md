## Problem solving

It’s better to speak put the steps to give interviewer the impression you can follow logic of solving problems

1) Understand the problem:
    * can I restate the problem in my own words?
    * what are the inputs & outputs?
    * how should I label the pieces of data?

2) Explore concrete examples:
    * start with simple examples
    * move to more complicated ones
    * what if there is a hollow invalid input?

3) Break it down:
    * in other work just write so-called ‘word-solution’ of the problem
    * to show the interviewer you can ponder over

4) Simplify/solve:
    * find the difficulty that impedes you for now
    * ignore difficulty and bypass so far it
    * in the end incorporate difficulty

5) Look back and refactor:
    * can I derive the upshot differently?
    * can I improve the performance?
    * can I refactor the code?
    * how did others solve it?
