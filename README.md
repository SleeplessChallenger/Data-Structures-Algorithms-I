# Data-Structures-Algorithms-I
Here I'll post code for various DSA problems that were covered by me 

Actually, there are various topics which were covered. Starting from Big O notation and ending with Dynamic Programming. 

1)To check for some notes go to the file, i.e. Big O.py, and there in the thread of the code you can stumble upon insriptions that I've found aiding. 

2)In patterns there is a bunch of problems that can be useful. Like multiple pointers, sliding windows etc

3)Sorting Algorithms include: linear search, naive string search, binary search, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort
* in regard to quick sort: the first one is for JS (with helper) and the subsequent one is for Python

4)"Problemsolver" is a type of file where I delineated best mental attitude which you should use when approaching to dabble with problem. 

!!!All in all I tried to test the code before uploading it here, but if there are some flops, be sure to create Pull Request
