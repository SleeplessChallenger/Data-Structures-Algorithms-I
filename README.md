## Data-Structures-Algorithms-I

My first repo with DSA. Updated in March 2023 as it will be used for my course for master students

* Actually, there are various topics starting from Big O notation and ending with Dynamic Programming.

1) To check for some notes go to the file, i.e. Big O.py, and there in the thread of the code you can
   stumble upon inscriptions that I've found aiding.

2) In patterns there is a bunch of problems that can be useful. Like **2 pointers**, **sliding window** etc

3) Sorting Algorithms include:
    * linear search
    * naive string search
    * binary search
    * bubble sort
    * selection sort
    * insertion sort
    * merge sort
    * quick sort
    * radix sort

    * in regard to quick sort: the first one is for JS (with helper) and the subsequent one is for Python

4) "problem-solving-approach.md" is a type of file where I delineated the best mental attitude which
   you should use when approaching to dabble with problem.

5) Dynamic programming is pretty dense in regard to notes, be free to read
