Here I'll post code for various DSA problems that were covered by me 

Actually, there are various topics which were covered and they'll be uploaded in sequence. Starting from Big O notation and ending with Dynamic Programming. 

!!!To check for some notes go to the file, i.e. Big O.py, and there in the thread of the code you can stumble upon insriptions that I've found aiding.
